        <h4 style="background-color:blue;"> 
            You attack the bear. You throw a right-hand cross pouring all your being into it as if was your last punch. 
            As the mighty hit connects to the beast you see its eyes fill with killing intent. 
            You step back to try to run, but itâ€™s too late. 
            The bear lunges at you ripping a chunk of your stomach, 
            You kick and scream in pain as the bear stands over your body with malicious eyes watching, you bleed out and become a corpse.
